## Scripts!

This is a collection of everyday script that I use that go tossed out with the bath water when Fig got acquired by AWS. 

### Gum 
A good amount of these use "Gum" which is just a nice way of prompting in the terminal. 
```
brew install gum
```

### Aliasing
You get the basic aliases that I've determined, but feel free to customize. If you run `./setup.sh` it will add the path to your `.zshrc`.
