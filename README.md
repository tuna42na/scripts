## Scripts!

This is a collection of everyday script that I use that go tossed out with the bath water when Fig got acquired by AWS. 

### Gum 
A good amount of these use "Gum" which is just a nice way of prompting in the terminal. 
```
brew install gum
```

### Aliasing
I like to use aliases for all of these. I have included the an alias file in this batch. Just throw the code into your `.zshrc` file and it will load you own custom aliases. Neat!
```
source RELATIVE_ALIAS_PATH
```
